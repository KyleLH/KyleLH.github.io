I didn’t need anything fancy, really just to serve\na bunch of files from a folder. There are a lot of ways you can do this, whether\nit’s with a WEBrick, a small python http.server, generate a rails app (or any of\nthe <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255\"> innumerable other variations </a>) —\nthose aren’t my go-to’s though. Although they definitely get the job done, you\ndon’t have much control over anything, and I don’t want to deal with setting up\na bunch of config for weeks, especially since I’m doing this in my free time. So\nI picked my personal favorite flavor, which is spinning up a tiny express server\nthat looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> express <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'express'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> app <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">express</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\napp<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">use</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'/'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> express<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">static</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'.'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\napp<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">listen</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">3000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'Listening on port 3000...'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I was ecstatic after writing this because it reminded me exactly why I fell in\nlove with JavaScript + Node.js: it has an incredible Time to First Wow ™. What I\nmean by that is, the amount of time it takes to go from having nothing to having\nsomething someone can actually pick up and play with is seconds. Coming from my\nnormal day to day where I’m working in pretty robust JSON APIs, web servers, and\nSPAs, where much of my time is spent getting lost in configuration options,\nreading tomes full of docs, or figuring out why my monitoring alerts aren’t\nfiring, this little node applet was a nice crisp breath of fresh air. Technology\nshould empower us to achieve real-world outcomes, not just invent new technical\nproblems to bikeshed about or make us think about decisions orthogonal to our\nend-goal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When it comes down to it, what I love about a nice short Time to First Wow ™ is\nthat it helps users get their hands on whatever I’m building as soon as\npossible. While the above example is of course very small, keeping with this\nidea of small, simple solutions from day one can help you push towards this\nright out of the gate. Assuming your users are cognizant that you’re trying to\ngather early feedback, this can be a great tool to get eyes on your project\nearly in its development. From there, you can aggregate that user feedback,\niterate on ideas and features, and start adding real user value right from the\nbeginning. Because at the end of the day, what’s the point of creating\napplications if not to fulfill real end-user needs?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Time to First Wow","date":"October 10, 2019","description":"A summary of my thoughts on barriers to entry of technologies"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/time-to-first-wow/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/inspiration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Inspiration"}},"next":null}}}
