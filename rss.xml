Disclaimer: This is entirely my opinion; there are many ways to slice it, this is just my favorite!
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I was starting up a new project and needed a file server
to serve some static assets. I didn’t need anything fancy, really just to serve
a bunch of files from a folder. There are a lot of ways you can do this, whether
it’s with a WEBrick, a small python http.server, generate a rails app (or any of
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255&quot;&gt; innumerable other variations &lt;/a&gt;) —
those aren’t my go-to’s though. Although they definitely get the job done, you
don’t have much control over anything, and I don’t want to deal with setting up
a bunch of config for weeks, especially since I’m doing this in my free time. So
I picked my personal favorite flavor, which is spinning up a tiny express server
that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; express &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;express&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; app &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;/&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; express&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Listening on port 3000...&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ecstatic after writing this because it reminded me exactly why I fell in
love with JavaScript + Node.js: it has an incredible Time to First Wow ™. What I
mean by that is, the amount of time it takes to go from having nothing to having
something someone can actually pick up and play with is seconds. Coming from my
normal day to day where I’m working in pretty robust JSON APIs, web servers, and
SPAs, where much of my time is spent getting lost in configuration options,
reading tomes full of docs, or figuring out why my monitoring alerts aren’t
firing, this little node applet was a nice crisp breath of fresh air. Technology
should empower us to achieve real-world outcomes, not just invent new technical
problems to bikeshed about or make us think about decisions orthogonal to our
end-goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, what I love about a nice short Time to First Wow ™ is
that it helps users get their hands on whatever I’m building as soon as
possible. While the above example is of course very small, keeping with this
idea of small, simple solutions from day one can help you push towards this
right out of the gate. Assuming your users are cognizant that you’re trying to
gather early feedback, this can be a great tool to get eyes on your project
early in its development. From there, you can aggregate that user feedback,
iterate on ideas and features, and start adding real user value right from the
beginning. Because at the end of the day, what’s the point of creating
applications if not to fulfill real end-user needs?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inspiration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Inspiration is what gets you up in the morning. It’s that feeling where you

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently after finishing a major in Computer Science, I’ve been thinking a lot
about how I should spend my time, and why I do what I do (that being mainly web
development these days). Although I finished my major fall semester, I still had
one last class before graduating, so I decided to try to work throughout the
semester instead of taking it easy. Though my friends may argue that my sitting
around in sweats crushing some carefully crafted CoffeeScript and getting to
work with some truly incredible people may be a walk in the park compared to
their once-every-other-week problem sets, it was different than anything I’ve
ever experienced. There were no rules, everyone was watching your every
semicolon (but not really because CoffeeScript), and more importantly we were
all working together. It might sound strange, but you’ve never felt the pain of
working on a team until you’ve done a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git merge master&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;, and
seen more red than Freddie Krueger on Elm Street. After a while I got into the
rhythm, writing specs for features and bugs, and throwing together angular
directives with JST templates, and it started making a little more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why was I doing it? Obviously there’s the axiomatic generalization that it’s
my job, but, I had to ask myself, why did I pick this job? Was it because I was
comfortable with front-end development? Or maybe because I’m not fit for a role
in algorithms development, as it’s been deemed by previous potential employers
(cough all of silicon valley cough). After I thought about it for a bit, all the
while still working and chatting with my co-workers over slack or reviewing PR’s
on GitHub, I came to realize that it’s not the money, it’s not the work, and
it’s not even my wonderful peers– it’s the chance to make a difference, and to
sculpt the &lt;a href=&quot;virtual%20landscape%20of%20our%0Afuture&quot;&gt; virtual landscape of our future &lt;/a&gt;. It may seem overtly self-centered and egocentric, but I dare say you
have to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, what else wakes you up more than the satisfaction of the noumenon
and anticipation of what lies in store for tomorrow&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
